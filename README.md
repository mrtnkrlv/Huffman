# Huffman
Files to perform Huffman compression and decompression using a priority queue algorithm based on a min-heap structure.

The included files are: 
- a linked list library
- a hashtable library
- a heap library
- a buffer function and file manipulation library
- the project's main file

Currently, a user has to input a compressed file along with an uncompressed version of that file to perform decompression:
this is because no function has been created to reconstruct a Huffman tree only with the binary data provided by a 
compressed (binary) file, due to time constraints. Otherwise, the code works as expected.
